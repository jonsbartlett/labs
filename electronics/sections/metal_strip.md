# Metal Object Sensor

For this year's game we will have metal tape at various points around the arena and as you are probably aware, the cans are also metal!

Using what you have learned in previous labs about switches, you can place metal contacts on your robot so you can detect when you have passed a strip or are touching a can.

The schematic below illustrates the basic circuit setup. Anything inside of the black border is in your robot:

*Figure 1: Pull-up configuration for the sensor circuit*

In the above figure, the green lines represent metal contacts and the grey box is a metal object. This can be used to detect if your robot is touching something metal. If you are not touching something, then the two contacts form an open circuit. When a metal object is touched by the two contacts, this forms a circuit and allows current to flow across the contacts and object.

When the contacts are not on a metal object the Arduino pin is pulled **HIGH** by **R1**.

## Tasks

 - Using the theory learned above, build a circuit that will implement the above functionality and think about how you could use this for your robot.

 - Connect an LED to pin 2 on the Arduino and make it turn on when the circuit is completed. You will need to put a resistor in series with the diode to avoid damaging it. We'd recommend a value of $$330\Omega$$.

The diagram below illustrates the required circuit for above:

*Figure 2: LED Circuit with protecting diode*

 - Write a program that keeps track of how many times you have completed the circuit and make it buzz or iluminate an LED after the circuit has been completed three times. Connect the metal contact pin into 5.

## Simon Says (Extension)
Let's have a bit of fun, load the file `simon_says.py` and put it onto your robot USB!

You can download it from [here](https://gist.github.com/PeterJCLaw/8d3ecfe70c331fe9683e2e264e829bc0).

You will also need to rename the `simon_says.py` to `main.py`

**Note: You will have to edit the `simon-says.py` lines 12-16 to the pins you're using. The INPUT-PIN variable is for your metal contacts and the OUTPUT-PIN variable is for your LEDs**

Wire up two more of the metal contact circuits and two more LED circuits and plug the LEDs into pins [3, 4] and the other two metal contact pins into [6, 7]

Run the Simon Says game on your robot and play the game!
